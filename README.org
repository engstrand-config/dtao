* =dtao-guile=
A general-purpose status bar for [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/dwl-guile][ =dwl-guile= ]], configurable in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]].
=dtao-guile= is based around ``blocks'' (clock, tags etc.) that the user writes in Guile.

=dtao-guile= supports the IPC protocol, which =dwl-guile= implements.
This enables features like clickability for tags and more.

** Goal
We wanted a hackable, simple status bar that we could configure in Guile.
The project started out as a fork of [[https://github.com/djpohly/dtao][ =dtao= ]]but has diverged from creator djpohly's original concept.

** Installation
#+begin_quote
=dtao-guile= is still under development, so proceed with caution!
#+end_quote

The best way to install and use =dtao-guile= is through our Guix channel  [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/home-service-dtao-guile][home-service-dtao-guile]], which (as the name suggests) provides a [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Home-Configuration.html][Guix Home]] service for =dtao-guile=.

** Running

As mentioned in the installation section, it's better to run =dtao-guile= via [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/home-service-dtao-guile][home-service-dtao-guile]]. However, you can still run the program easily on any Linux distribution.

=dtao-guile= expects a configuration file to be provided via the =-c= command-line option (See [[./example/config.scm][./example/config.scm]]).

#+begin_src sh
  dtao -c ./example/config.scm &
#+end_src

With the provided configuration in the [[./example][example folder]], the status bar will look like this.
